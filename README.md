# Reports made in Spring 2024
Reports made for work done at Tufts as a master's student in bioengineering in Spring 2024.

## Computational Systems Biology
Diabetes systems biology performed. Using HumanGEM systems biology model freely available online, I created a Python library to find affected reaction pathways from genes associated with type 2 diabetes. Genetic associations were collated from publicly available GWAS. 4-5 subtypes of type 2 diabetes were identified. Unique subsets of reactions are dysregulated according to metabolic flux balance analysis. Groups of genes share the same dysregulation in the same subsets of all biological reactions.

## Cellular Agriculture
### Bovine muscle and adipogenic differentiation with reduced fetal bovine serum (report 1)
Bovine (cow) fat cells cultivated using standard fetal bovine serum, reduced serum and serum-free formulations. Cells were harvested from biopsies at 2 farms in Connecticut, USA. Successful differentiation of bovine satellite muscle cells into fibers and accumulation of lipids in adipocytes.

### Design of Experiment for insulin and ascorbic acid concentrations in differentiation medium for adipocytes and texture profile characterization of alginate hydrogel for scaffolding of cultured meat (report 2)
Reported weakly positive effects of insulin and ascorbic acid on lipid accumulation in fat cells (adipocytes). Alginate hydrogels are used as biomaterial scaffolds and food gels. Here, alginate hydrogel scaffolds are seeded with adipocytes and compared to ground beef in texture characteristics.

### Bovine satellite muscle cell oxidation compared under 2 curcumin-based antioxidant treatments (report 3)
Higher cell viability and lower oxidation reported under food-grade antioxidant treatment.

## Cell and microbe cultivation
### Pegfilgrastim case study
Pegfilgrastim is used to treat neutropenia, or a lack of neutrophils, by stimulating growth of neutrophil colonies. Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated form of colony-growth stimulating factor. Neutropenia is common when treating cancer with chemotherapy. In this report, our team reported scale-up of bioprocess cultivation of the antibody and its downstream pegylation. Market value of the drug was estimated and biosimilars were highlighted.
