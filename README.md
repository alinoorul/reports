# Reports made in Spring 2024
Reports made for work done at Tufts as graduate student in bioengineering in Spring 2024.

## Computational Systems Biology
Diabetes systems biology performed. Using HumanGEM systems biology model freely available online, I created a Python library to find affected reaction pathways from genes associated with type 2 diabetes. Genetic associations were collated from publicly available GWAS. 4-5 subtypes of type 2 diabetes were identified. Unique subsets of reactions are dysregulated according to metabolic flux balance analysis in each subtype.
